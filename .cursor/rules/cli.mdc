# CLI Rules

## Command Line Usage

- **Use `pnpm` for all package management and script execution commands.**
- Do **not** use `npm` or `yarn` unless explicitly required by a dependency or tool.
- Update documentation, scripts, and examples to reference `pnpm` instead of `npm`.
- If a third-party tool or dependency requires `npm` or `yarn`, document the exception clearly in the relevant place (e.g., in the README or a comment).

### Examples

```bash
# ✅ Good: Using pnpm
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
pnpm run test

# ❌ Avoid: Using npm or yarn
npm install
yarn install
npm run dev
yarn dev
```

## Rationale

- `pnpm` offers better performance, disk space efficiency, and strictness compared to `npm` and `yarn`.
- Consistent use of `pnpm` avoids dependency resolution issues and ensures reproducible builds.

## Migration

- If converting an existing project or script, replace all `npm`/`yarn` commands with their `pnpm` equivalents.
- Update CI/CD pipelines and documentation accordingly.
